# odin-recipes
This project is testing my skills with HTML and making a website that connects to recipes.  It's going to look crude, but the purpose is to enhance my HTML skills to set it up for future work down the line in future lessons from The Odin Project.

I will be showing how to create headers, paragraphs, links, images.
