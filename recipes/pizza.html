    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>American - Basic</p>
    <p>This homemade pizza dough is the perfect one to make a couple of batches, freeze for later, and pull out the night on a Thursday.  <em>Let's get started!</em></p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Warm Water - <strong>1 1/2 Cups</strong></li>
            <li>Yeast - <strong>2 1/4 Teaspoons</strong></li>
            <li>Flour <strong>3 1/2 Cups</strong></li>
            <li>Olive Oil - <strong>2 Tablespoons</strong></li>
            <li>Salt - <strong>2 Teaspoons</strong></li>
            <li>Garlic Salt - <strong>1 Teaspoon</strong></li>
            <li>Basil - <strong>1 Teaspoon</strong></li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Making the Pizza Dough</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the <strong>warm water</strong> a large mixing bowl.  Sprinkle the <strong>yeast</strong> over the warm water and let it sit for 5 minutes, until the yeast is dissolved.</li>
            <li>After 5 minutes stire if the yeast hasn't dissolved completely.  The yeast should begin to foam, which indicates that it is still active and alive.</li>
            <li>Using the mixing paddle attachment, mix in the <strong>Flour</strong>,<strong>Salt</strong>, <strong>Garlic salt</strong>, <strong>Olive oil</strong>, and <strong>Basil</strong> on low speed for a minute.</li>
            <li>KNead the pizza dough on low to medium speed using the dough hook until the dough is smooth and elastic, which is about <em>10 minutes</em>
            <p>If you don't have a mixer, you can mix the ingredients together and knead them by hand.  If the dough seems a little too wet, sprinkle it with a little more flour.</p></li>
            <li>Spread a thin layer of olive oil over the inside of a large bowl.  Place the pizza dough in the bowl and turn it around so that it gets coated with the oil.</li>
            <li>Cover the dough with plastic wrap and let it sit in a warm place until it doubls in size, at least <em>1 - 1.5 hours.</em> You can let it sit for several hours if you want.
            <p>The longer the rise, will improve the flavor of the pizza crust.</p>
            <p>If you don't have a warm spot in the house, you can heat the oven to <em>150 degrees</em>.  Let the oven cool till it is just a little warm, then place the bowl of dough in this warmed oven to rise.</p>
            <p><em>At this point, if you want to make more dough ahead of time, you can freeze the dough in an airtight container for up to <strong>2 weeks.</strong></em></p></li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Preparing the Pizza</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place a <strong>pizza stone</strong> on a rack in the lower 3rd of your oven.  Preheat the ove ne <strong>450 Degrees F</strong> for at least <strong>30 minutes</strong>.</li>
            <li>Remove the plastic cover from the dough and punch the dough down so it deflates a bit.  Divide the dough in half.  Form two round balls of dough.  Place each in it's own bowl, cover with plastic and let sit for 10 minutes. </li>
            <li>Prepare your desired toppings.
                <p><em>Note</em> you are not going to want to lad up each pizza with a lot of toppings, as the crust will end up not crisp that way.</p>
                About a <strong>3rd Cup</strong> of <strong>Tomato Sauce</strong> and <strong>Cheese</strong> will be sufficient for each pizza.  One to two mushrooms thinly sliced will cover a pizza.
            </li>
            <li>Working one ball of dough at a time, take one ball of dough and flatten it with your hands on a slightly floured work surface.  
                <p>Starting at the center and working outwards, use your fingertips to press the dough to <em>1/2-inch thick</em></p></li>
            <li>Turn and stretch the dough until it will not stretch further.  Let the dough relax <strong>5 minutes</strong> and then continue to stretch it until it reaches the desired diameter <strong>10-12 inches</strong>.</li>
            <li>Use your palm to flatten the edge of the dough where it is thicker.  You can pinch the very edges if you want to form a lip.</li>
            <li>Brush the top of the dough with olive oil to prevent it from getting soggy from the toppings.  Use your finger tips to press down and make dents along the surface of the dough to prevent bubbling.  Let rest another <strong>5 minutes.</strong></li>
            <li>Repeat with the other ball of dough</li>
            <li>Lightly sprinkle your pizza peel (or flat baking sheet) with corn meal.  Transfer one prepared flattened dough to the pizza peel.  If the dough has lost it's shape in the transer, lightly shape it to the desired dimensions.</li>
            <li>Spoon on the tomato sauce, sprinkle with cheese, and place yor desired toppings on the pizza.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle some cornmeal on the baking stone in the oven <em>(watch your hands, the oven is hot!)</em>
            <p>Gently shake the peel to see if the dough will easily slide, if not, gently lift up the edges of the pizza and add a bit more cornmeal.</p></li>
            <li>Slide the pizza off of the peel and on to the baking stone in the oven.  Bake pizza one at a time until the crust is bornwed and cheese is golden.  About <strong>10-15 minutes</strong>.  If you want, toward the end of the cooking time you can sprinkle on a little more cheese.</li>
        </ol>
