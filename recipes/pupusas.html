    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Latino-El Salvador-Intermediate</p>
    <p>You're here for the recipe and how to get this deliciousness onto a plate to be consumed as soon as possible, <em>so let's go</em>.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p><strong><em>1 cup</em></strong> of Masa flour yeilds 4 pupusas.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Masa - <strong>4 cups</strong></li>
        <li>Queso Fresco <strong>1 16oz</strong></li>
        <li>Cooking oil -<strong>1 cup</strong><em> ( I use olive oil, but whatever one you prefer)</em></li>
        <li>Salt - <strong>4 teaspoons</strong></li>
        <li>Water - <strong>4 1/2 cups <em>warm</em> water</strong></li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Take the <strong>Queso Fresco</strong> and crumble it with your hands in a medium sized bowl.
        <p>Place into the fridgerator to remain chilled until needed later on.</p></li>
        <li>In a large bowl pour the <strong>4 cups of <em>Masa</em></strong>.</li>
        <li>Add the <strong>4 teaspoons of <em>Salt</em></strong>.</li>
        <li>With either you hand or a fork, stir the salt in with the Masa until the salt is throughly mixed.</li>
        <li>Take the <strong>1 cup of <em>Olive oil</em></strong>and add it to the Masa/salt mix.</li>
        <li>Mix the <strong>Olive Oil</strong> into the Masa with the fork or you hands.</li>
        <li>Take out a <strong>skillet</strong> and set the temperature around <em>350 degrees</em>.</li>
        <li>As the skillet gets to temp, take the <strong> 4 1/2 cups of <em>warm water</em></strong> and add it to the mix <em>1 cup at a time</em> until all is in.</li>
        <li>Take the <strong>Queso Fresco</strong> from the fridgerator.</li>
        <li>Get your hands wet and grab a <em>ping pong ball</em> sized amount of Masa dough and roll it to resemble a ball.</li>
        <li>Place your thumbs into the ball and create a bowl from the dough.  (This is where the Queso Fresco will be placed into).</li>
        <li>Take about a <em>tablespoon</em> of Queso Fresco and place it within the Masa bowl you've made.</li>
        <li>With your fingers pinch the bowl closed so no Queso Fresco comes out.</li>
        <li>Flatten the Masa and Queso with your hands. 
            <p>To avoid the Masa getting stuck to your hands and undoing all the work you've done, you want to alternate the hand that is pushing the ball flat.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Once the ball resembles an engorged tortilla place it onto the <strong>skillet</strong>.</li>
        <li>After around 3 minutes flip the pupusa to the other side.</li>
        <li>Rinse and repeat until the Masa mix is gone, and you have a lovely stack of pupusas to be consumed by your lonesome, or with loved ones (if you want to share).</li>

    </ol>
